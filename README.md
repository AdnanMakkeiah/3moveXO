XO (or TicTacToe) is a human-computer game, but the gameplay differs from traditional rules. 
A player places two symbols and plays the third symbol. 
If the player wins, the game ends with the player winning. 
If he does not win, the symbol he placed remains, but the first symbol he placed is cleared.
